# Badges and Stats #

Badges are small icons showing some pieces of information such as
versions, test results, downloads, license.  See the first line of the
Python package **setuptools**'s README file which shows its current
PyPI version, supported Python version, etc.

[shields.io](https://shields.io) is one of the services that help you
to customise your badges.  For example, it provides [a list of version
badges](https://shields.io/category/version), so when you embed
`https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/<package>` into your README file like
this:

```
[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/setuptools)](https://pypi.org/project/pysarplus/)
```

It will show:

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/setuptools)](https://pypi.org/project/pysarplus/)

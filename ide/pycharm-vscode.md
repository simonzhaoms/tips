# PyCharm vs Visual Studio Code (VS Code) #

I haven't used VS Code much, so I can't really give a comprehensive
and fair comparison.

Integrated development environments (IDEs) are a bundle of tools
helping boost programming productivity.  So in terms of productivity,
I personally think PyCharm is better.

Both PyCharm and VS Code have a plethora of plugins and extensions:
* [PyCharm Professional Plugins ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/pycharm)
* [Extensions for the Visual Studio family of products](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode)


## PyCharm ##

### Pros ###

* Wonderful functionality out-of-the-box
* Powerful code analysis and autocompletion
    + Follow PEP-8
    + Variable type inference
    + Detect unused methods, variables and more
* Deep support for pytest fixtures (navigation, completions and find
  usage, etc.)
* Refactoring tools are really time-saving
* Suitable for bigger projects


### Cons ###

* Charge for advanced version (If it is good, why not pay?)
    + Jupyter Notebook plugin
* Slow (Not on Mac)
* Only Python: For other language, there are a lot of other JetBrains
  IDEs
* Too bloated


## VS Code ##

### Pros ###

* Free
* More than Python
* Lightweighted
* Highly customizable
* Fast, responsive (Lightweighted sometimes means fast)
* Azure and .NET integration
* Free Jupyter Notebook plugin


### Cons ###

* Not full-fledged (But is growing)
* Linting is not as good
* Autocompletion is not as good either
* Plugins may be only available for Windows?
* Simple Git integration?
* Search is not as good.  No search history?

* Running multiple instances of VS Code becomes heavy?
* Flexibility sometimes means no norms
* Text editor, NOT an IDE
* Develop extensions (plugins) is not easy (From my own experience in
  2017 for developing an extension for C++)
* Make by Microsoft?
